description: Bootstrap a best-practice GitHub Copilot Coding Agent configuration for a new or unconfigured project. Use when a user asks to set up GitHub Copilot, create copilot-instructions.md, or configure GitHub Copilot for the first time. Also use when the user says things like "set up my Copilot config", "bootstrap Copilot", or "initialize GitHub Copilot". Grounded in official GitHub Copilot Coding Agent best practices.

Set up a GitHub Copilot Coding Agent configuration for this project.

**Before creating any files:**

1. If `.github/copilot-instructions.md` already exists, stop and suggest running `/gc-config-optimize` instead.
2. Scan for toolchain clues: `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, `Makefile`, `README.md`, and similar.
3. If the project description was not provided in `$ARGUMENTS` and the toolchain cannot be determined, ask what the project produces and what stack is involved.

**Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** with this structure (keep under ~8 000 characters):

```markdown
# <Project Name>

<One-line description and stack summary.>

## Commands

- Build: `<command or TODO>`
- Test: `<command or TODO>`
- Lint: `<command or TODO>`

## Architecture

<Key directories and patterns — only non-obvious parts. Omit if too new.>

## Conventions

<Concrete rules that deviate from defaults. Never standard language conventions.>

## Don't

- Don't commit secrets or credentials to git
- Don't use `--force` git flags — fix the underlying issue instead
```

**Optionally also create:**

- `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` — if the project has distinct subsystems with different conventions; use `applyTo: "<glob>"` frontmatter to scope each file
- `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` — if a package manager or build tool is detected; job name must be `copilot-setup-steps`, runtime under 59 min; always include dependency caching (`actions/setup-node@v4` with `cache: 'npm'`, `actions/setup-python@v5` with `cache: 'pip'`, `actions/setup-go@v5` with `cache: true`, or `actions/cache@v4` for Cargo) — without caching every agent session reinstalls all dependencies from scratch
- `AGENTS.md` — if other AI tool directories (`.claude/`, `.gemini/`, `.codex/`) are present

**After creating files**, list what was created, note any TODO placeholders, and mention:

- Fill in TODO commands once they are known
- Run `/gc-config-optimize` once the project has more content
- Add MCP servers via GitHub repository settings (Settings → Copilot → MCP servers)
- When Copilot makes a mistake and the user corrects it, Copilot logs a one-line summary to `.github/copilot-learnings.md` instead of modifying config files directly. Run `/gc-config-optimize` periodically to incorporate accumulated learnings into the configuration.

**Limitations vs. Claude Code's `/cc-config-init`:** No permissions deny/allow, no PostToolUse hooks, no autocompact control, no `@`-import progressive disclosure (so `copilot-learnings.md` is not auto-loaded — `/gc-config-optimize` is required to apply it), no MCP automation via files.

Did this output meet your expectations? If not, describe what was off and Copilot will log the correction to `.github/copilot-learnings.md`.

> **Note:** Corrections are not auto-loaded on every session. Run `/gc-config-optimize` periodically to review and incorporate them.
