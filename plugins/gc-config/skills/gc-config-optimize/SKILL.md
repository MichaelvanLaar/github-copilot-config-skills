Audit and improve the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent configuration in this project.

**If `.github/copilot-instructions.md` does not exist**, stop and suggest running `/gc-config-init` instead.

**Step 1 — Inventory and metrics snapshot**

Read all Copilot config files and report:

- `copilot-instructions.md` character count (limit: ~8 000)
- Number of files in `.github/instructions/`
- Whether `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` exists
- Whether `AGENTS.md` exists

**Step 2 — Inventory** also reads `.github/copilot-learnings.md` if it exists.

**Step 3 — Audit findings** (group as must fix / should fix / nice to have)

Check for:

- **Length**: over 8 000 characters → must fix; suggest which sections to extract
- **Anti-patterns**: personality instructions, file-by-file descriptions, linter-enforced rules → should fix
- **Missing Commands section** or only vague commands → should fix
- **Invalid `applyTo`** in any `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` file → must fix
- **Missing `copilot-setup-steps.yml`** when a build system is detected → should fix
- **Missing dependency caching** in `copilot-setup-steps.yml` (`actions/setup-node` without `cache:`, `actions/setup-python` without `cache:`, `actions/setup-go` without `cache: true`, raw Cargo commands without `actions/cache@v4`) → should fix; every agent session otherwise reinstalls all dependencies from scratch
- **Wrong job name** in `copilot-setup-steps.yml` (must be `copilot-setup-steps`) → must fix
- **Contradictions** between `AGENTS.md` and `copilot-instructions.md` → must fix
- **No architecture overview** → nice to have
- **No path-specific instruction files** for a multi-subsystem project → nice to have

**Step 4 — Learnings review** (if `.github/copilot-learnings.md` exists)

- Classify each entry: recurring pattern (promote to a config file) or one-off (delete).
- Include promoted entries in the findings report under the appropriate tier.
- When applying changes: add promoted content to config files and remove processed entries from `copilot-learnings.md`; delete the file entirely if all entries are resolved.

**Step 5 — Wait for approval**, then apply only approved changes (including any learnings changes).

**Step 6 — Report** before/after metrics, list every file modified, and note how many learnings entries were promoted, deleted, or remain.

**Limitations vs. Claude Code's `/cc-config-optimize`:** No permissions deny/allow, no PostToolUse hooks, no autocompact control, no `@`-import progressive disclosure (so `copilot-learnings.md` is not auto-loaded — this skill is required to apply it), no MCP automation via files.

Did this output meet your expectations? If not, describe what was off and Copilot will log the correction to `.github/copilot-learnings.md`.

> **Note:** Corrections are not auto-loaded on every session. Run `/gc-config-optimize` periodically to review and incorporate them.
