# Optimize GitHub Copilot Configuration

You are auditing and improving an existing GitHub Copilot Coding Agent setup. Your job is to identify what's good (preserve it), what's missing, what's bloated, and what violates current best practices — then fix it with the user's approval.

## Step 1: Full inventory

Read and catalog everything that exists before suggesting any changes.

### Configuration files to read

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- All `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files
- `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`
- `AGENTS.md` (project root)
- `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` (project root, if present — for cross-tool consistency)

If `.github/copilot-instructions.md` does not exist, **stop** — tell the user there is no Copilot configuration to optimize and suggest running `copilot-init` instead.

### Project context

- Package manager and dependencies (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, etc.)
- Build/test/lint commands
- CI/CD configuration in `.github/workflows/`
- Other AI tool directories: `.claude/`, `.gemini/`, `.codex/`

### Metrics snapshot

Report before proposing any changes:

- `copilot-instructions.md` character count (limit: ~8 000)
- Number of path-specific instruction files in `.github/instructions/`
- Whether `copilot-setup-steps.yml` exists
- Whether `AGENTS.md` exists

## Step 2: Length audit

Check that `copilot-instructions.md` stays within the ~8 000 character limit. Content beyond this limit may be silently truncated by the Coding Agent.

- **Under 8 000 characters** → no length finding
- **8 000–10 000 characters** → flag as "should fix"; suggest sections to move to path-specific instruction files
- **Over 10 000 characters** → flag as "must fix"; report the excess and list the top candidates for extraction

## Step 3: Content quality audit

Check `copilot-instructions.md` for missing essentials and known anti-patterns.

### Anti-patterns to flag as "should fix"

- Personality instructions ("act as a senior engineer", "think carefully")
- File-by-file codebase descriptions (the Coding Agent can read files itself)
- Rules that the configured linter/formatter already enforces
- Duplicate content that also exists in `AGENTS.md`

### Missing essentials to flag as "should fix"

- No Commands section or only vague commands (the Coding Agent needs exact command strings to avoid CI failures)

### Missing structure to flag as "nice to have"

- No architecture overview or directory layout section

## Step 4: Path-specific instruction coverage

Assess whether `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files would improve the setup.

- **Multi-language or multi-subsystem project with no path-specific files** → flag as "nice to have" and suggest glob patterns (e.g., `src/frontend/**`, `**/*.test.ts`)
- **Existing path-specific files with missing or malformed `applyTo` frontmatter** → flag as "must fix"; a missing `applyTo` field means the file never applies

## Step 5: copilot-setup-steps.yml audit

If the project has a build system, package manager, or dependency manager:

- **Build system detected but `copilot-setup-steps.yml` absent** → flag as "should fix"; pre-installing dependencies reduces failed agent sessions and token waste
- **`copilot-setup-steps.yml` exists** → verify it has the required `copilot-setup-steps` job name; flag any structural issues as "must fix"

If no build system is detected, skip this step.

## Step 6: AGENTS.md consistency check

If `AGENTS.md` exists:

- Compare coding rules and commands between `AGENTS.md` and `copilot-instructions.md`
- **Contradictory rules** → flag as "must fix" and show both conflicting passages
- **Duplicate content** → flag as "should fix" and suggest which file should be the single source of truth

## Step 7: Generate findings report

Present all findings grouped by category. For each finding, state what the issue is, why it matters, and what you'd change.

### Must fix (correctness issues)

- `copilot-instructions.md` exceeds 8 000 characters
- Path-specific instruction file missing or invalid `applyTo` field
- `copilot-setup-steps.yml` missing required `copilot-setup-steps` job name
- Contradictory rules between `AGENTS.md` and `copilot-instructions.md`

### Should fix (quality improvements)

- Anti-patterns in `copilot-instructions.md`
- Missing Commands section
- Build system present but no `copilot-setup-steps.yml`
- Duplicate content between `AGENTS.md` and `copilot-instructions.md`

### Nice to have (polish)

- No architecture overview
- No path-specific instruction files for a multi-subsystem project
- No `AGENTS.md` when multiple AI tools are in use

**Wait for user approval before making any changes.**

## Step 8: Apply approved changes

Make only the approved changes. For each modified file, show a brief before/after summary.

## Step 9: Final summary

After all changes:

1. List every file modified with a one-line description of changes
2. Report new metrics: character count, number of instruction files, etc.
3. Compare to before (e.g., "`copilot-instructions.md`: 12 400 chars → 5 800 chars")
4. Note anything intentionally left unchanged and why
5. Remind the user to commit the changes

### What this skill cannot do

Unlike the Claude Code equivalent (`cc-optimize`), this skill cannot configure:

- **No permissions deny/allow** — Copilot has no file-level access control
- **No PostToolUse hooks** — no hook system for auto-formatting after edits
- **No autocompact control** — no equivalent to `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE`
- **No `@`-import progressive disclosure** — `copilot-instructions.md` loads in full on every session
- **No MCP automation** — MCP servers are configured in GitHub repository settings UI, not via files

## What NOT to do

- Don't modify files before getting user approval
- Don't refactor things that work well — if a config is correct and clean, say so
- Don't suggest MCP servers here — those are configured via the GitHub UI
