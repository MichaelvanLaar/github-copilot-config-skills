description: Bootstrap a GitHub Copilot Coding Agent configuration (copilot-instructions.md and optional supporting files). Lighter alternative to the full copilot-init skill.
---

Set up a GitHub Copilot Coding Agent configuration for this project.

**Before creating any files:**

1. If `.github/copilot-instructions.md` already exists, stop and suggest running `copilot-optimize` instead.
2. Scan for toolchain clues: `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, `Makefile`, `README.md`, and similar.
3. If the project description was not provided and the toolchain cannot be determined, ask what the project produces and what stack is involved.

**Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** with this structure (keep under ~8 000 characters):

```markdown
# <Project Name>

<One-line description and stack summary.>

## Commands

- Build: `<command or TODO>`
- Test: `<command or TODO>`
- Lint: `<command or TODO>`

## Architecture

<Key directories and patterns — only non-obvious parts. Omit if too new.>

## Conventions

<Concrete rules that deviate from defaults. Never standard language conventions.>

## Don't

- Don't commit secrets or credentials to git
- Don't use `--force` git flags — fix the underlying issue instead
```

**Optionally also create:**

- `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` — if the project has distinct subsystems with different conventions; use `applyTo: "<glob>"` frontmatter to scope each file
- `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` — if a package manager or build tool is detected; job name must be `copilot-setup-steps`, runtime under 59 min
- `AGENTS.md` — if other AI tool directories (`.claude/`, `.gemini/`, `.codex/`) are present

**After creating files**, list what was created, note any TODO placeholders, and mention:

- Fill in TODO commands once they are known
- Run `copilot-optimize` once the project has more content
- Add MCP servers via GitHub repository settings (Settings → Copilot → MCP servers)

**Limitations vs. Claude Code's cc-init:** No permissions deny/allow, no PostToolUse hooks, no autocompact control, no `@`-import progressive disclosure, no MCP automation via files.
